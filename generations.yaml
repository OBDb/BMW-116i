    description: "The first BMW 116i was part of the inaugural 1 Series generation, available in both five-door (E87) and later three-door (E81) hatchback body styles. It was powered by a naturally aspirated 1.6L inline-four engine producing approximately 115 HP, paired with either a manual or automatic transmission. As an entry-level model, it offered BMW's renowned rear-wheel drive handling dynamics in an affordable package, though with more modest performance than its higher-powered siblings."

    description: "The second-generation 116i featured a turbocharged 1.6L inline-four engine with power outputs ranging from 136 HP to 109 HP (in later, efficiency-focused versions). Available in both five-door (F20) and three-door (F21) body styles, it maintained BMW's rear-wheel drive layout. This generation introduced more technology including start/stop systems and BMW's EfficientDynamics suite. A facelift in 2015 brought updated styling, improved engines, and enhanced technology."

    description: "The current 116i is based on the F40 platform and represents BMW's shift to front-wheel drive for the 1 Series. It features a turbocharged 1.5L three-cylinder engine producing approximately 109-116 HP depending on the market. Available exclusively as a five-door hatchback, it offers improved interior space due to the transverse engine layout. The 116i benefits from BMW's latest technology including digital instrumentation options and advanced driver assistance systems, while still focusing on delivering an engaging driving experience despite the platform change."
